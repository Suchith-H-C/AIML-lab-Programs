# AiML_Lab_Programs

1)Implement Naive Bayes models and Bayesian networks. (Demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard heart disease data set etc).

2)Implement a simple linear regression algorithm to predict a continuous target variable based on a given dataset.

3)Develop a program to implement a Support Vector Machine for binary classification. Use a sample dataset and visualize the decision boundary.

4)Write a program to demonstrate the ID3 decision tree algorithm using an appropriate dataset for classification.

5)Implement a KNN algorithm for regression tasks instead of classification. Use a small dataset, and predict continuous values based on the average of the nearest neighbors.

6)Implement the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the Iris dataset, printing both correct and incorrect predictions.

7)Develop a program to implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm, fitting data points and visualizing results.

8)Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test it with suitable datasets.

9)Implement a Q-learning algorithm to navigate a simple grid environment, defining the reward structure and analyzing agent performance.

10)Write a python program
  a.to perform tokenization by word and sentence using nltk.
  b.to eliminate stop words using nltk.
  c.to perform stemming using nltk.
  d.to perform Parts of Speech tagging using nltk."
